# Gain-Filter

Laplace transform transfer function - also denoted the continous-time transfer function - of a first order lowpass filter is

$$
H(s) = \frac{y(s)}{u(s)} = \frac{1}{T \cdot s + 1}
$$

Where $T$ is the time-constant. $u$ is filter input, and $y$ is filter output.

The discretization of this continous-time filter is just the exponential weighted moving average with:

$$
a = \frac{h}{T + h} = 1-g
$$

$a$ being the filter parameter.

$$
y(t_k) = u(t_k) \cdot a + (1-a) \cdot y(t_k-1) 
$$

[The Kalman Observation Update is a Gain-Filter](http://bilgin.esme.org/BitsAndBytes/KalmanFilterforDummies): The [kalman optimal filtering](tech-kalman-filter.html) contains this operation with linear algebra and $a$ being the kalman gain. 
Therefore it is fitting to call the exponential weighted moving average a *gain filter*.
When a kalman filter reaches a steady state the kalman gain often converges to a fixed value.
With the proper filter parameter *gain* a simple *gain filter* will perform the same as a kalman filter with constant kalman gain.
The filter parameter *gain* is simple to tune for low-dimensional problems. 
Those often accur during signal processing. 
This makes the *gain filter* a useful tool for many filtering problems.

The filter parameter $a$ corresponds to a certain timestep duration $h$.
Those parameters fully describe a *gain filter*:

$$
\text{Gain Filter: } (h, a)
$$

The simple formulation above assumes a constant time step $h$.

But in practical filtering problems the time steps are often not constant.
To use the *gain filter* anyway the filter parameter needs to be adjusted to the different timestep.
In a practical solution one would store the last filter update time and compute a timestep with differencing the current time or measurement time.


The state of a *gain filter* contains a current estimated value and optionally the last update time.

## Convert filter parameter to different time step

### Given

Two gain filter $(h_1,a_1)$ & $(h_2,a_2)$ with different time step $h$ and same time constant $T$:

$$
h_1, h_2
$$


$$
a_1 = \frac{h_1}{T_1 + h_1}
$$

$$
a_2 = \frac{h_2}{T_2 + h_2}
$$

$$
T_1 = T_2
$$

### Looking for


$$
a_2
$$

### Solution


$$
T_1 = T_2 = \frac{h_1 \cdot (1-a_1)}{a_1}
$$

$$
a_2 = \frac{h_2}{T_2 + h_2}
$$

$$
a_2 = \frac{h_2}{\frac{h_1 \cdot (1-a_1)}{a_1} + h_2}
$$



### Derivation


$$
a_1 = \frac{h_1}{T_1 + h_1} 
$$

$$
h_1 = (a_1) \cdot (T_1 + h_1) = T_1 \cdot a_1 + h_1 \cdot a_1
$$

$$
h_1 \cdot (1-a_1) = T_1 \cdot a_1
$$


$$
T_1 = \frac{h_1 \cdot (1-a_1)}{a_1} = T_2
$$


$$
a_2 = \frac{h_2}{T_2 + h_2} 
$$

$$
h_2 = (a_2) \cdot (T_2 + h_2)
$$


$$
a_2 = \frac{h_2}{T_2 + h_2}
$$


$$
a_2 = \frac{h_2}{\frac{h_1 \cdot (1-a_1)}{a_1} + h_2}
$$

# Applications

- Compute P-Controller-Gain $k_{rest}$ from gain-filter behaviour. Can then also be used to correctly adapt to timestep. 
  - for $x_{new} = x + (x_{target}-x) \cdot k_{rest} \cdot t_{dt}$
    - $k_{rest} = \frac{k_{gain}}{k_{gain} t_{dt} - k_{gain} t_{dt gain reference} + t_{dt gain reference}}$
    - [Details in Sympy JupyterNotebook](gainfilter_pid-rate.html)
  - for $x_{new} = x + (x_{target}-x) \cdot k_{rest}$
    - $k_{rest} = \frac{k_{gain} t_{dt}}{k_{gain} t_{dt} - k_{gain} t_{dt gain reference} + t_{dt gain reference}}$
