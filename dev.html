## ROS

## Languages

### Prolog

- [2018-10-10 Hackernews Discussion](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=18188003)

### Python

- Use [%autoreload](https://blog.godatadriven.com/write-less-terrible-notebook-code) in your python notebooks to reload imported packages on file change
- [5 useful Python packages from Kaggle’s kernels](https://medium.com/logicai/5-useful-python-packages-from-kaggles-kernels-you-didn-t-know-existed-part-2-4b35ba2d812): pyahocorasick, Pandas-profiling, funcy, fancyimpute, missingno

Disable all warnings:

```python
import warnings
warnings.filterwarnings('ignore')
```

## Virtualization

- I use [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) to define linux development virtual machines
- [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) is a easy to use virtual machine provider that operates well with Vagrant
- [How to save/remove existing Vagrant box and restore the saved vagrant box](https://www.webfoobar.com/index.php/node/52)

- [Boot VM from physical harddrive or USB stick](https://www.howtogeek.com/187721/how-to-boot-from-a-usb-drive-in-virtualbox/) for example:
VBoxManage internalcommands createrawvmdk -filename C:\physicalDisk4.vmdk -rawdisk \\.\PhysicalDrive4

## Software Configuration Management

- [[wikipedia]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_configuration_management):
  In software engineering, software configuration management (SCM or S/W CM) is the task of tracking and controlling changes in the software, part of the larger cross-disciplinary field of configuration management. SCM practices include revision control and the establishment of baselines. If something goes wrong, SCM can determine what was changed and who changed it. If a configuration is working well, SCM can determine how to replicate it across many hosts.

## Online tools

- Online compiler [C++ shell](http://cpp.sh/) is very useful for small C++ tests à la "hm I wonder if this C++ construct would compile, let's check"
- Online compiler [godbolt](https://godbolt.org/) compiles many Languages (Analysis, Assembly, C, C++, Cppx, CUDA, D, Go, Haskell, ispc, LLVM IR, Pascal, Rust, Swift) and lets you inspect generated assembly for various compilers and targets directly in browser
- Latex in Browser [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/)
- Draw symbol and get corresponding latex code with [Detexify](http://detexify.kirelabs.org/classify.html)
- Draw symbol and find corresponding unicode characters with [Shapecatcher](http://shapecatcher.com/)
- [Client Side JavaScript Password Generator](tools-pwgen.html)

## Benchmarking

- [C++ Benchmarks: Container Lookups](https://constantsmatter.com/posts/cpp-benchmark-container-lookup/)
- [Benchmarking with Linear Regression](https://blog.janestreet.com/core_bench-micro-benchmarking-for-ocaml/) By differencing slopes, one can also estimate the impact of each software component by benchmarking code with components replaced by no-ops. One should also always measure the slope of no-ops to get the overhead of the benchmark tool itself.

## Human Machine Interface

- [User Perception Of Performance Delays](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/rail#ux)

## Excel

- [Excel Translator](https://excel-translator.de/) to translate excel functions in different languages (English, German, etc.)
- To draw from normal distributed random variable in Excel cell: <br \>
  English: "NORMINV(RAND(); mean; std)"  <br \>
  German: "NORMINV(ZUFALLSZAHL(); mean; std)"
